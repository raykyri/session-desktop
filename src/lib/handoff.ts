// applied as a blanket per-message cap, so nothing is truncated that the budget
// could have carried whole. The order of priority is anchor turn, then the last
// couple of turns, then older history — because the freshest exchanges hold the
// live state of the work (what was just tried, what broke, what comes next)
// while older ones have already been distilled into the files on disk.
